\chapter*{Preface}
This report is developed by project group SW507E14 from the department of Computer Science at Aalborg University as part of the fifth semester project from September 2014 to December 2014. The theme of the project is \emph{Embedded Systems} and the focus of this report is developing an autonomous robot.

During the project period, the study method \emph{Problem-based learning}, also known as \emph{The AAU model}, has been used. This report is developed throughout a semester structured like this. This means that the project is heavily focused around using material from the courses. Methods and techniques learned during the courses will be applied throughout the project. It is expected that the reader of this report has knowledge about these methods and techniques.

%This report is written by a group of 5th semester software students at Aalborg University. Throughout the report appropriate terminology is used, which means that the readers must have some knowledge about computer science, more specifically about machine intelligence.

The report uses Harvard citation, that provides the name of the author(s) of the source. As an example, the book used in the course \emph{Machine Intelligence}, is shown as~\citep{artificialintelligencebook}.
