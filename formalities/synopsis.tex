Embedded systems are everywhere and make up a large percentage of all electronic systems in the world. An embedded system could for example be a robot. For solving small tasks, autonomous robots has become more and more common and have a lot of application in today's society.
\\\\
The project is focused on developing the \projname{}, a prototype robot which can search a limited environment for small objects while collecting these. This idea is the basis for this project. The \projname{} is a prototype, for which the concept could later be expanded into a full scale product.
\\\\
It has been concluded that the \projname{} fulfils the given requirements and works well as a proof of concept. Unfortunately the desired algorithm could not be fully implemented because of sensor inaccuracy, but a simpler algorithm with similar efficiency was implemented instead. There are a lot of improvements that could be made, most importantly better hardware.
