\chapter{Implementation} \label{cha:implementation}

In this chapter, the implementation procedure of the features from \charef{cha:design} are documented, as well as the overall architecture and the choices made in regard to this. The behaviour of the robot is also described, followed by an explanation on how the implemented motor controller works.

%Finally, the finished modules of the \projname{} were listed and documented.
