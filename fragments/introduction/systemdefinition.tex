\section{System definition} \label{sec:system_definition}

With the project focus stated into a problem statement and delimited to a prototype size, the desired system can now be defined based on the physical requirements in \secref{sec:physical_requirements}. The system definition of the \projname{} is the following:

	\medskip\noindent \textit{Given a number of objects to find, the robot should be able to navigate an environment, defined by black lines, while searching for these objects. While doing this, the robot picks up objects it detects and stores them within its storage container. This must be completed within limited time. The \projname{} should pick up objects within reasonable time, which is defined to 30 seconds per object.}
