	\textbf{System Definition} 
	\end{center}
	\rule{\linewidth}{0.035cm}
    
	\medskip\noindent \textit{Given a number of objects to find, the robot should be able to navigate an environment, defined by black lines, while searching for these objects. While doing this, the robot picks up objects it detects and stores them within its storage container.}
