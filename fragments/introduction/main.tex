%As the years go by, new and improved technologies are created and introduced into the world. This progress leads to a number of new ideas, that can be implemented into the world. One of these ideas, is the idea to have self-driving cars, that are able to drive around safely and without interaction from the users. Autonomous cars have already been developed and are being used on the roads. As an example Google has made a working self-driving car~\citep{GoogleCar}. If cars can be made, the possibilities to create a wide range of usable vehicles like ambulances, public transportation, delivery cars and trucks can be developed as well. 

%Autonomous cars can improve the traffic in a number of different ways, if it was an ideal software, that was implemented on all vehicles. First of all, all accidents and crashes could be avoided, if there was some system that made sure that every car followed the rules. This would make the traffic run smoother, and make it more efficient overall. 

%On the smaller scale, robot are being used in private houses and in the industrial sector. Robots can be used 

%This project concern itself with developing an autonomous robot collector. Given a number of objects, the robot should be able to navigate an environment, marked with black tape, by locating the edges and decide that it should not move outside of these. It should be able to explore all of the environment, looking for objects, until it has found all of these. When it finds an object, it should be able to pick it up utilising a crane-claw, and dump the objects in a storage container on the back of the robots frame.
