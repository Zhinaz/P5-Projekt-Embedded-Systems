In this chapter the functionality of the final robot will be tested and described. In relation to the specified requirements in \secref{sec:requirement_specification}, all the requirements is tested. The tests show whether or not the robot is able to perform the actions from the requirements.

The requirements for the robot: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Navigate the environment within the boundaries.
\item Control collection arm to pick up and store objects of specified size.
\item Find and collect all objects within the time limit.
\end{itemize}

\section{Test setup}

To test the \projname{} and its ability to fulfil the three requirements, a testing area similar to a real world environment was set up. This area was determined by a boundary which the robot was not allowed to cross, objects outside the boundary to test the boundary detection, and a certain amount of objects with a size and weight that the robot has proven in \secref{sec:object_specification} to be able to find and collect.

\end{figure}

The area was a rectangle with the dimensions 1 m times 1.5 m framed by a layer of black tape. Each test included four cylindrical cans used as objects. Each can had a height of 7 cm, a diameter of 6.5 cm, and a weight of 10 g. An example of a tested environment can be seen in \figref{fig:test-setup}

\section{Results}

All the requirements were tested in one combined test. For each module of functionality, observations were made during the tests. The observations for all three requirements are listed below.

\textbf{Navigate the environment within the boundaries}
\begin{itemize}
\item Sometimes the robot does not detect the black lines before it is too late.
\item The width of the black lines is important. If the black lines is too thin the robot is less likely detect the boundary.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Control collection arm to pick up and store objects of specified size}
\begin{itemize}
\item The signal from the slave to the master is not always received when it is finished.
\item Sometimes the robot does not see an object, even if it is right in front of the robot.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Find and collect all objects within the time limit}
\begin{itemize}
\item If the distance between the objects is too large, the robot will never find all the objects. This is a matter of the ultrasonic sensor waves not returning fast enough before the robot have rotated too far away from where they were sent out.
\item The time used to find objects increases if there are objects on the other side of the black lines. This is because that after hitting the black line, the \projname{} will deem the spotted object on the other side unreachable and the time spent driving towards it will be wasted.
\end{itemize}
