\chapter{Design} \label{cha:design}

With the prior analysis done, some design decisions for the robot can be made. This chapter will contain a description of all the design decisions the implementation of the \projname{} will be based on. A platform has already been chosen, but there is also the matter of choosing the optimal operating system. The chosen operating system and the reasons for why it was chosen will be explained. Afterwards the the functionality of the robot will be described, as well as the chosen algorithm for solving the problem. This will result in some final requirements for the \projname{}-

%With the platform specified and the necessary hardware tested, the time has come to choose which firmware to install on the LEGO NXT. Along with that comes a description of the libraries used by the language that comes with the chosen firmware. The different sensors, motors, and features of the robot, that were tested in \secref{sec:hardware}, will be further described and explained.
