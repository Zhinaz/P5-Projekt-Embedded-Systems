\section{Functionality description} \label{sec:functionality_description}
In this section the overall functions and the different parts of the \projname{} are described. The fully built \projname{} includes four sensors and four servo motors, which means that it also includes two NXT Bricks, as it only supports three outputs pr. Brick for the motors. The robot drives in the environment, using the interactive servo motor until it locates an object, using the ultrasonic sensor, or the black boundary using the colour sensor. If it locates an object, the master brick transmit a signal to the slave brick to commence the arm task. During this time, the robot stands still, waiting on a signal. All the components and how they are connected to the NXT Bricks is shown in \figref{fig:robot_overview}. 

\subsection{Brick communication}
The two LEGO NXT bricks used for the robot is required to communicate in order to start and stop certain tasks. The integrated Bluetooth 2.0 module is used for communication between the NXT Bricks. One of the two LEGO NXT Bricks is chosen to be the master and the other one is the slave. The master unit controls the primary task of the robot, while the slave is used to handle a smaller, parallel task when receiving instructions from the master unit.

\subsection{Colour sensor} 
The robot is equipped with two colour sensors on the front of the robot, at each side. This is used to detect the black lines that specify the boundary of the environment. Based on the returned light the colour sensors return the RGB value to the LEGO NXT brick. The two colour sensors are handled by the master unit. 

\subsection{Ultrasonic sensor}
The ultrasonic sensor is placed in the front of the robot, just under the claw. This is used to detect the distance to the objects in front of the robot. The master unit is controlling the ultrasonic sensor.
%The ultrasonic sensor can measure the distance from the sensor to other objects. The robot use the ultrasonic sensor for detecting the distance to other object in front of the robot. The ultrasonic sensor are also controlled by the master unit. 

\subsection{Compass sensor}
The compass sensor is placed on the top or the robot, at the end of an arm, so that it is located as far from the bricks and motors as possible. This is to reduce the noise from the bricks and motors magnetics fields. The sensor is pointing in the same direction as the robot.

The compass sensor is used to help ensure precision in the robots movement. This increased precision in movement is used when searching for objects, and when turning to the exact degree where the next object is located. When the object are discovered during the scanning phase, their location are mapped according to distance and the angle between them.

\subsection{Interactive servo motor}
The four interactive servo motors is used for two tasks. The first task is to move the robot around the environment. This includes driving forward, backward, and turning. The second task is the arm and the claw. This task consist of squeezing the claw around a detected object and holding this until the arm has reached the point, where the claw can let go of the object, and this lands in the storage behind the robot. Then the arm returns to the starting position, ready to grab a hold of new objects. Both task use 2 motors. The driving task is handled by the master unit, and the arm task is handled by the slave unit.

\subsection{Motor controller}
The tests in \secref{sec:servo_motor} proves that the motors used in the project are not very precise. It was decided to implement a motor controller to solve the precision issues. The objective for the motor controller is to ensure that the motors reach the same distance at the same time. 

The controller takes as input how many steps each motor has turned at any given time. Based on the steps, and the direction, the speed is increased or decreased on the left motor. The left motor is selected as the motor where the speed is changed, and the right motor moves at constant speed. The motor controller also ensures that the robot stops at the targeted number of steps $+/-$ an acceptable error margin.

It is not possible to make the motors 100\% precise because of the minimum speed for driving the robot is too high. This is due to the construction of the robot. To deal with this problem, a reasonable error margin is chosen. The error margin is used in two cases: First if the motors difference in steps is inside this error margin the robots speed is not adjusted. Secondly if the motor is inside the target steps, the robot will stop moving.  

The result of the controller is a robot that, even though the hardware is imprecise, moves straight and behave as expected.
