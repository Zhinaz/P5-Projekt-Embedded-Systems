\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}

The prototype of the \projname{} was able to fulfil the project goals specified in the problem statement, see \secref{sec:problem_statement}. Staying inside the desired boundary was made possible by utilising two colour sensors. The ultrasonic sensor allows the robot to spot objects while it is moving within the area and determine the distance between these objects and itself. Lastly, the constructed claw along with the ultrasonic sensor were able to determine when an object is within the claws reach, making it able to successfully collect it. 

Most of the hardware were imprecise, but with the used algorithm and the motor controller, the result is sufficient for this prototype. If the \projname{} should be produced for proper usage it would require better hardware, especially to locate objects.
